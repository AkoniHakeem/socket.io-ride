- taxi request consideration
    - should find drivers
    - find driver with 10 km radius
        - to achieve this
            - open a channel for available drivers on the drivers' namespace
                - collect and store drivers current location and timestamp or
                - we could open an event to receive location updates from drivers who are online every 5 mins
                - update the driver as available
            - on request for driver 
                - collect user's pick up location and destination
                - check available driver within 10 km distance from the pick up location
                - to calculate the distance limit we could use a geo-spatial tool/library like turfs.js
    - find drivers with a specific vehicle preference
        - to achieve this,
            - collect drivers vehicle type on connection or
            - access drivers vehicle type from datastore
            - collect users vehicle preference on request or
            - access users vehicle preference from datastore
            - compare users vehicle preference with available drivers' vehicle*
